### Hi there üëã ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=haimengzhao)

I am Haimeng Zhao (ËµµÊµ∑Ëêå), an undergraduate of physics at Tsinghua University. 

My research interests include:

- AI for Science, especially Physics & Astrophysics
  - I developed [MAGIC](https://github.com/haimengzhao/magic-microlensing), a machine learning pipeline for microlensing analysis with realistic data quality. 
- Quantum Information, Algorithms & Machine Learning
  - I studied quantum generative learning, and designed a variational qPCA running backwards as a generative model: [G-qPCA](https://github.com/haimengzhao/g-qpca).
  - I studied the non-IID quagmire in quantum federated learning, and proposed an alternative called [quantum federated inference](https://github.com/haimengzhao/quantum-fed-infer).
- Quantum Many-body Physics, Theory & Computation
  - I'm actively learning about both the theoretical and computational aspects of condensed matter physics.
- Machine Learning Stuff
  - I implemented a [full covariance version](https://github.com/haimengzhao/full-cov-mdn) of the mixture density network / gaussian mixture model
