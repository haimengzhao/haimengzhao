### Hi there üëã ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=haimengzhao)

I am Haimeng Zhao (ËµµÊµ∑Ëêå), a PhD student in Physics at Caltech. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics with Honours from Tsinghua University in 2024.

My research interests include:


- Quantum Information, Algorithms & Machine Learning
  - I have worked on quantum state tomography [with bounded gate complexity](https://github.com/haimengzhao/bounded-gate-tomography) and [with neural quantum states](https://github.com/netket/netket).
  - I studied the non-IID quagmire in quantum federated learning, and proposed an alternative called [quantum federated inference](https://github.com/haimengzhao/quantum-fed-infer).
  - I studied quantum generative learning, and designed a variational qPCA running backwards as a generative model: [G-qPCA](https://github.com/haimengzhao/g-qpca).
  
- Quantum Many-body Physics, Theory & Computation
- AI for Science, especially Physics & Astrophysics
  - I developed [MAGIC](https://github.com/haimengzhao/magic-microlensing), a machine learning pipeline for microlensing analysis with realistic data quality. 
- Machine Learning Stuff
  - I implemented a [full covariance version](https://github.com/haimengzhao/full-cov-mdn) of the mixture density network / gaussian mixture model
