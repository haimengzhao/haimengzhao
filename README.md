### Hi there üëã ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=JasonZHM)

I am Haimeng Zhao (ËµµÊµ∑Ëêå), an undergraduate of physics at Tsinghua University. 

My research interests include:

- AI for Science, especially Physics & Astrophysics
  - I've developed [MAGIC](https://github.com/JasonZHM/magic-microlensing), a machine learning pipeline for microlensing analysis with realistic data quality. 
- Quantum Information, Algorithms & Machine Learning
  - I've proposed a quantum generative learning model based on variational qPCA. It conceptually unifies GAN, VAE & Flow in the quantum regime. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/JasonZHM/g-qpca)
- Quantum Many-body Physics, Theory & Computation
  - I'm actively learning about both the theoretical and computational aspects of condensed matter physics. It from Qubit!
- Machine Learning Stuff
  - I'm collabrating with my friends on a federated learning framework.
  - If you're looking for an implementation of mixture density network / gaussian mixture model with full covariance matrices, [check this out!](https://github.com/JasonZHM/full-cov-mdn)
